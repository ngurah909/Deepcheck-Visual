# 🧠 DeepCheck Visual

**DeepCheck Visual** is a web-based tool built with **Streamlit** that utilizes a deep learning model (MobileNetV2) to classify images as either **Fake** or **Real**. It provides a simple and interactive interface for both casual users and researchers to analyze image authenticity through deep learning.

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Upload and classify your own images (JPG, PNG)
- 🧪 Test using a built-in test dataset
- 🖼️ View image previews, prediction results, and confidence scores
- 📈 Visual breakdown of class probabilities
- 🧾 Generate and download an Excel report
- 🧹 Delete selected entries from the report
- 📝 Download annotated prediction images with label & confidence

## 🧠 Model

The app uses a **MobileNetV2** model trained to detect and classify images as:
- **Fake**
- **Real**

The model was trained using TensorFlow and expects RGB images resized to 224x224 pixels.
